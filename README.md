# 📊 Dart Expense Analyzer

A simple Dart command-line program that helps users analyze their daily or weekly expenses. It calculates the total, highest, and average expenses, and also shows which days were above or below average.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts a list of expenses from the user (comma-separated)
- Calculates:
  - ✅ Total amount spent
  - ✅ Highest single expense
  - ✅ Average daily expense
- Analyzes each day to check if the expense was above or below average

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Enter your expenses for the week (comma-separated): 120.5, 80, 45, 160, 30

Total spent: R435.50
Highest expense: R160.00
Average expense: R87.10

Day 1: R120.50 - ABOVE average
Day 2: R80.00 - BELOW average
Day 3: R45.00 - BELOW average
Day 4: R160.00 - ABOVE average
Day 5: R30.00 - BELOW average
```
